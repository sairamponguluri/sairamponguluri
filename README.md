#  Hi, I'm Sairam Ponguluri

Cloud Infra Engineer | Builder of InfraLite, Spantum, Invyu, Expantr  
Passionate about building developer-first infra tools, simplifying cloud automation, and making ephemeral environments work like magic.  

-  4+ years in cloud engineering (Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, Terraform, CI/CD)
-  M.S. in Data Science — but I'm more interested in how things *run* than just analyzing them
-  I build tools that reduce friction, preserve context, and scale dev velocity

## 🔧 Projects I'm Actively Working On

###  [InfraLite](https://github.com/infralite)  
*Lightweight backend infra engine for indie devs and small teams.*  
Features zero-config security, AI-aided automation, and instant deployment.

- Built with FastAPI, Docker, Terraform, Caddy, and deployed on AWS EC2  
- Includes modular microtools like `prompt-planner`, `vercel-deployer`, and `infra-rewind`  
- SSL Grade A secured with automated HTTPS

> "Infra shouldn’t be invisible — but it should be effortless."

###  [Spantum](https://github.com/spantum) *(Coming Soon)*  
*Persistent memory + automation layer for dev workflows.*  
Think of it as your project’s second brain: it tracks, recalls, and evolves with your tools and flow.

- Local-first, privacy-respecting memory kernel
- Tracks actions, generates documentation, and helps explain systems even post-launch

---

###  BookPublisherDistributionDB Analytics  
*Built an end-to-end data analytics platform for a book publishing company.*

- SQL Server → Azure migration with DMA  
- Automated pipelines via Azure Data Factory and SSIS  
- Real-time dashboards in Power BI, ML model integration via SageMaker

---

###  [Expantr](https://github.com/expantr) *(Private for now)*  
*Tool to help early-stage projects define vision, scale team onboarding, and ship docs post-launch.*

---

###  [Invyu](https://github.com/silentinfra/invyu) *(WIP)*  
*Video + debug + feedback visualizer for solo devs.*  
Captures intent, not just code — helps you and your users understand what’s being built and why.

---

##  Background

-  Master’s in Data Science – Lewis University  
-  Ex: SQL Server Migration | Data Engineering | DevOps Automation  
-  Obsessed with making infra less fragile, more human-friendly
